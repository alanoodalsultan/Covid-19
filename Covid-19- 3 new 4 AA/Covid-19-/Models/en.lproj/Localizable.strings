"RIYADH: The Ministry of Health reported 25 new confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases, 44 critical cases and 29 recoveries in the Kingdom on Monday. The total number of infections in the country reached 549,720, while the recovery tally reached 538,885. One new death was reported, bringing the tally of fatalities in the Kingdom to 8,834. The ministry advised everyone to contact the toll-free number 937 for consultations and inquiries around the clock and to obtain health information and services. Meanwhile, The WHO warned on Monday that omicron variant of coronavirus carries a very high global risk of surges, as more countries reported cases, prompting border closures and reviving worries about the economic recovery from a two-year pandemic. Scientists have said it could take weeks to understand the severity of omicron, which was first identified in southern Africa. Its emergence has caused a strong global reaction, with countries imposing travel curbs and other restrictions, worried that it could spread fast even in vaccinated populations. On Sunday, a South African doctor who was one of the first to suspect a new strain said omicron appeared so far to be producing mild symptoms" = "RIYADH: The Ministry of Health reported 25 new confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases, 44 critical cases and 29 recoveries in the Kingdom on Monday.

"The government’s measures to protect against the new omicron variant of coronavirus come into force on Tuesday, with face masks becoming mandatory once again in England’s shops and settings such as post offices, hairdressers and public transport. All travellers returning to the UK will also be required to take a PCR test, and self-isolate until they receive a negative result, as Boris Johnson continues to insist vaccines and boosters remain the best line of defence. There are now 14 confirmed cases of omicron in the UK – five in England and nine in Scotland – after two new cases were found in London over night, and six across Lanarkshire and Glasgow this morning. Anyone who believes they might be a contact of one of these people is being told to self-isolate immediately, regardless of their age or vaccination status. Mr Johnson will address the nation this evening, at around 5pm, in a bid to urge everyone to follow the new rules and “do their bit” to help slow the spread of the new variant. He will also encourage all non-vaccinated members of the public to come forward and get a jab." = "The government’s measures to protect against the new omicron variant of coronavirus come into force on Tuesday, with face masks becoming mandatory once again in England’s shops and settings such as post offices, hairdressers and public transport.
